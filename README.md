# odin-recipes

<strong>By doing this simple project as a first step to a complete further complicated projects I learned a lot of things include:</strong>

- Basics searching methods for technical and code-related materials. And avoiding use AI tools to do things done without taking any effort to solve the problems by myself. 
- How to write good, **imperative-styling** commits.
- Make use of _Github Pages_ to publish this site for others on **the Odin Project Community**
