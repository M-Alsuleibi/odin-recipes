    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This asparagus and mozzarella stuffed chicken dish is easy enough for a Tuesday, but looks pretty enough for company. It has a really fresh flavor and goes great with roasted potatoes or rice.</p>
    <h2>ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>8 asparagus spears, trimmed</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons mayonnaise for brushing (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>

        <li>Place each chicken breast between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place four asparagus spears down the center of each chicken breast, then top with mozzarella. Roll chicken around fillings to make tidy, compact rolls.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken, seam-side down, to the prepared baking dish. Brush chicken breasts with mayonnaise if using and sprinkle bread crumbs over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        
        
    </ol>
