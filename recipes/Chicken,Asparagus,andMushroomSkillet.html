    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken with asparagus and mushroom dish is sautéed in a garlic and
      olive oil base. You can add more mushrooms if desired. Serve with rice or
      pasta — and a glass of white wine.
    </p>
    <h2>ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

      <li>1 ½ cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice</li>

      <li>1 ½ teaspoons white cooking wine</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon dried parsley</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>⅛ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 medium skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, sliced</li>
      <li>½ pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into thirds</li>

      <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Melt butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir garlic, lemon juice, wine, parsley, basil, salt, and oregano into hot butter-oil mixture.</li>
      <li>Add chicken; cook and stir until chicken is browned, about 3 minutes. Flip, reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
      <li>Add asparagus; cook and stir until asparagus is bright green and starting to become tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in mushrooms and cook until they release their juices, about 3 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve hot over rice or pasta. Enjoy!
